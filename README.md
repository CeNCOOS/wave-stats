### Recent Wave Stats Plots ###
P. Daniel

Plots are generated hourly, showing recent cdip buoy data as a time series and density plots. Plots are generated on the `concave` machine and copied over to `skyrocket8` at `/var/www/html/data/wave-stats`.



On the webserver, archive versions of the images are created with the name ending in %d%m%y (i.e. 2 digit day, 2 digit month and 2 digit year).  These need to be periodically compress if we want
to keep space usage to a minimum.  Archives exist of these back to 2023.
